# Cop-Group-Work

We are currently working on Student Grades Assignment. The Program will Running as followed:

Check and load binary file >> If no Binary, create one >> Start Menu >> Wait for User input >> Error Check Input >>  Go to input and display results. >> (assuming enter 4 exams was the input) Ask for input >> Error Check >> Confirm with user if 4 exams scores are valid >> error check >> if not, go back to Ask for input of 4 exams.
